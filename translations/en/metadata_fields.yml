indicator_global_description_1_3_1: "The indicator reflects the share of people who are effectively covered by the social protection system, including the lower limits of social protection. It also reflects the main components of social protection: child and maternity benefits, support for the unemployed, people with disabilities, victims of work injuries and the elderly. Effective social protection coverage is measured by the number of people who either actively contribute to the social security program or receive benefits"
оther_info_1_3_1: The data source for the variable “Proportion of the unemployed who receive unemployment benefits” is BHAS and the Agency for Labor and Employment of Bosnia and Herzegovina
indicator_global_description_3_1_2: "Percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel"
indicator_global_description_3_2_1: "The under - five mortality rate is the probability of a child born in a specific year or period dying before reaching the age of 5 years, if subject to age - specific mortality rates of that period, expressed as deaths per 1000 live births. The neonatal mortality rate is the probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life, if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births"
indicator_global_description_3_2_2: "Probability that a child born in a specific year or period will die during the first 28 completed days of life if subject to age-specific mortality rates of that period, expressed per 1000 live births. Neonatal deaths (deaths among live births during the first 28 completed days of life) may be subdivided into early neonatal deaths, occurring during the first 7 days of life, and late neonatal deaths, occurring after the 7th day but before the 28th completed day of life"
indicator_definition_3_4_1: "Probability of dying between the ages of 30 and 70 years from cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory diseases, is defined as the percent of 30 – year – old - people who would die before their 70th birthday from cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, or chronic respiratory disease, assuming that s / he would experience current mortality rates at every age and s / he would not die from any other cause of death (e.g., injuries or HIV / AIDS)"
indicator_definition_5_2_1: "This indicator measures the percentage of ever - partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older who have been subjected to physical, sexual, or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner, in the previous 12 months"
indikator_global_description_6_3_2: "The indicator is defined as the proportion of water bodies in the country that have good ambient water quality. Ambient water quality refers to natural, untreated water in rivers, lakes and groundwaters and represents a combination of natural influences together with the impacts of all anthropogenic activities. The indicator relies on water quality data derived from in situ measurements and the analysis of samples collected from surface and groundwaters. Water quality is assessed by means of core physical and chemical parameters that reflect natural water quality related to climatological and geological factors, together with major impacts on water quality. The continuous monitoring of all surface and groundwaters is economically unfeasible and not required to sufficiently characterize the status of ambient water quality in a country. Therefore, countries select river, lake and groundwater bodies that are representative and significant for the assessment and management of water quality to monitor and report on indicator 6. 3. 2. The quality status of individual water bodies is classified based on the compliance of the available water quality monitoring data for the core parameters with target values defined by the country. The indicator is computed as the proportion of the number of water bodies classified as having good quality (i.e. with at least 80 percentage compliance) to the total number of assessed water bodies, expressed as a percentage"
indicator_global_description_7_1_2: "Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology is calculated as the number of people using clean fuels and technologies for cooking, heating and lighting divided by total population reporting that any cooking, heating or lighting, expressed as percentage. Clean is defined by the emission rate targets and specific fuel recommendations (i.e. against unprocessed coal and kerosene) included in the normative guidance WHO guidelines for indoor air quality, household fuel combustion"
indicator_global_description_7_a_1: "The flows covered by the OECD are defined as all official loans, grants and equity investments received by countries on the DAC List of ODA Recipients from foreign governments and multilateral agencies, for the purpose of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems extracted from the OECD / DAC Creditor Reporting System (CRS). The flows covered by IRENA are defined as all additional loans, grants and equity investments received by developing countries (defined as countries in developing regions, as listed in the UN M49 composition of regions) from all foreign governments, multilateral agencies and additional development finance institutions (including export credits, where available) for the purpose of clean energy research and development and renewable energy production, including in hybrid systems. These additional flows cover the same technologies and other activities (research and development, technical assistance, etc.) as listed above and exclude all flows extracted from the OECD / DAC CRS"
indicator_global_description_9_2_1: "Manufacturing value added (MVA) as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) is a ratio between MVA and GDP, both reported in constant 2015 USD. Manufacturing value added (MVA) per capita is calculated by dividing manufacturing value added (MVA) in constant 2015 USD by population of a country or area"
indicator_global_description_11_2_1: "This indicator will be monitored by the proportion of the population that has convenient access to public transport. Access to public transport is considered convenient when a stop is accessible within walking distance along the street network of 500 m from a reference point such as a home, school, workplace, market, etc to a low - capacity public transport system (e.g. bus, Bus Rapid Transit) and / or 1 km to a high - capacity system (e.g. rail, metro, ferry)"
indicator_global_description_12_c_1: "In order to measure fossil fuel subsidies at the national, regional, and global level, three sub - indicators are recommended for reporting on this indicator, (1) direct transfer of government funds, (2) induced transfers (price support), and as an optional sub - indicator (3) tax expenditure, other revenue foregone, and underpricing of goods and services. The definitions of the IEA Statistical Manual (IEA, 2005) and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (ASCM) under the World Trade Organization (WTO) (WTO, 1994) are used to define fossil fuel subsidies. Standardized descriptions from the United Nations Statistical Offices Central Product Classification should be used to classify individual energy products"
indicator_global_description_15_a_1: "This is a twin indicator consisting of, (a) Official development assistance on conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, defined as gross disbursements of total Official Development Assistance (ODA) from all donors for biodiversity, (b) revenue generated and finance mobilised from biodiversity - relevant economic instruments, defined as revenue generated and finance mobilised from biodiversity - relevant economic instruments, covering biodiversity - relevant taxes, fees and charges, and positive subsidies"
indicator_global_description_17_3_1: "Foreign direct investment (FDI) is a category of investment that reflects the objective of establishing a lasting interest by a resident enterprise in one economy (direct investor) in an enterprise (direct investment enterprise) that is resident in an economy other than that of the direct investor. The lasting interest implies the existence of a long - term relationship between the direct investor and the direct investment enterprise and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise. The direct or indirect ownership of 10 percentage or more of the voting power of an enterprise resident in one economy by an investor resident in another economy is taken as evidence of such a relationship.

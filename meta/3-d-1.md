  The IHR monitoring questionnaire used by States Parties from 2010 to 2017 was
  revised in 2018, with changes to the format, capacities and indicators. This
  version – renamed the States Party self-assessment annual reporting tool
  (SPAR) – was used for reporting from 2018 to 2020.  In 2021, the SPAR tool was
  revised and further improved, taking account of the initial experience of
  countries with the COVID-19 pandemic. The second edition of SPAR (2021)
  contains 15 capacities and 35 indicators compared to 13 capacities and 24
  indicators in the first edition

  City: Banja Luka; Public transport stops data is sourced from OSM, TomTom,
  Eurostat and Copernicus Urban Atlas; Data used to estimate population with
  access to public transport is based on grid level population disaggregation
  from Eurostat or GHS-Pop; City/urban area used in the analyis has been
  generated using a classification approach based on the Degree of Urbanization
  approach to city definition. As a result, the urban/city area used for the
  indicator computation in this data table may be larger or smaller than the

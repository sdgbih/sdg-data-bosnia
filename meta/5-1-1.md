indicator_definition: The indicator is based on an assessment of legal frameworks that promote, enforce and monitor gender equality. The assessment is carried out by national counterparts, including National
Statistical Offices (NSOs) and / or National Womenâ€™s Machinery (NWMs), and legal practitioners / researchers on gender equality, using a questionnaire comprising 42 yes / no questions under four areas of law (i) 
overarching legal frameworks and public life, (ii) violence against women, (iii) employment and economic benefits, and (iv) marriage and family. The areas of law and questions are drawn from the international legal
and policy framework on gender equality, in particular the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), which has 189 States parties, and the Beijing Platform for Action. As
such, no new internationally agreed standard on equality and non  discrimination on the basis of sex was needed

The lasting interest implies the existence of a long - term relationship between the direct investor and the direct investment enterprise and a significant degree of influence on the management of the enterprise. The direct or indirect ownership of 10 percentage or more of the voting power of an enterprise resident in one economy by an investor resident in another economy is taken as evidence of such a relationship.
